### CSS Example

HTML uses tags to create the structure of a page:
```html
<span class="rule">
	Don't do it yourself! Use a template!
</span>
```


While CSS is used to style the appearance and behavior of tags:
```CSS
.rule {
	font-family: Z003;
	font-size: 150%;
	color: red;
	border: 1pt solid;
	padding: .3em;
}
```
